[![Build the plugin](https://github.com/tim-timman/fo4-autoload/actions/workflows/build.yaml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/tim-timman/fo4-autoload/actions/workflows/build.yaml)

> **Note**: Though the plugin now _builds_ against the new F4SE, it **doesn't** work. The code has to be updated for the new F4SE API.

Automatically loads either a fixed save, or the most recent save matching specified criteria (non-autosaves only, named saves only, etc.)

_This was forked from [reg2k/fo4-autoload](https://github.com/reg2k/fo4-autoload) and uses the forked and revised build system for the new repo structure of F4SE._
